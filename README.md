This repo contains a few projects I've worked on in several different languages. The main purpose of this repo is to demonstrate the general scale and complexity of projects that I have worked on outside of the industry.

Isaac-Airmet-Breakout is a breakout style game which I built from the ground up in c#. I run the project through VS.

Isaac-Airmet-Terminal is a small terminal replacement program which was constructed in Java. The folder contains instructions on how to run it.

Isaac-Airmet-BigBlueIsYou is based on the game Baba Is You, which is a puzzle solving based game. I worked on this project with one other developer as a team.

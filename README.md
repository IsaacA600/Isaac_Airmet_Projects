# Welcome!

This repo contains a few projects I've worked on in several different languages. The main purpose of this repo is to demonstrate the general scale and complexity of projects that I have worked on outside of the industry.

For projects that more closely relate to web and mobile application development, feel free to checkout Know Your Lemons & Learner Credential Wallet on the Google Play Store and Apple App Store. I worked on both of these during my time at Atomic Jolt.

## Isaac-Airmet-Breakout

This project is a breakout style game which I built from the ground up in c#. Using the arrow keys, you move a platform to bounce a ball into containers above you. Breaking containers gives you points based on the color, and the speed of the ball increases as points are obtained. Animations are included when you miss the ball, and you have 3 lives. High scores are also kept and stored locally.

## Isaac-Airmet-BigBlueIsYou

This is a very big project which I worked on with another developer as a team. It is based on the game Baba Is You, where you have to solve puzzles in order to win. The game includes multiple levels, as well as animations. 

## Isaac-Airmet-Terminal

 This is a small terminal replacement program which was constructed in Java. The folder contains instructions on how to run it. The program has a few limitations, but for the most part, it can do whatever your terminal can.

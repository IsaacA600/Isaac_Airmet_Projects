This repo contains a few projects I've worked on in several different languages.

Isaac-Airmet-Breakout is a breakout style game which I built from the ground up in c#. I run the project through VS.

Isaac-Airmet-Terminal is a small terminal replacement program which was constructed in Java. The folder contains instructions on how to run it.
